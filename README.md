# Rock Paper Scissor App

This project is my first attempt to write my own app using Kotlin and test it with Espresso in Android Studio.

> What I learned and want to work more on

- I had some trouble getting espresso to test my game mechanics because the text displayed in the result had 3 options depending on the game result and I couldn't find any "if x is clicked and computer displays y, z should be displayed in result text" testing options
- I want to add a title page to the app so it can be clicked between and tested
- I want to look deeper into the dependencies I used in my build.gradle file so I can know which ones I do and don't need, there was some differences between my learning sources
